I wanted a better life. A better career. A better way to make more money. A career in tech can lead to that. 

As I am building my career as a software developer,I want to be able to work toward achieving my goals. Of course I can achieve these goals through hard work, but,  due to financial obstacles like student loans and various bills, unfortunately I am not financially stable enough to just buy a plane ticket and go to the conference. I want to be able to not only be a change agent for my community in the tech field, but I also want to be able to be a positive influence, a role model to those younger than me. Not saying that I wont be able to do that otherwise, but having access to the resources that this conference offer, I will DEFINITELY be a step closer to reaching completing those marks.
